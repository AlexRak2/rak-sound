# rak-sound (WIP - Vibe with me - Open to PR)

> RakSound turns massive, messy sound libraries into a searchable, taggable, waveform-driven workflow.

RakSound is a high-performance desktop sound library manager built for **game developers**, **sound designers**, and **creators** who download huge SFX bundles (Sonniss, GDC packs, asset store libraries, field recordings, etc.) and need a fast way to **find**, **preview**, **categorize**, and **export** sounds without loading them into a DAW.

## 🎯 The Problem

You download 50GB+ of sound packs.

They come like this:


Hundreds of folders. Thousands of files. Zero organization.

Finding *one* sound becomes:

> open folder → scroll → preview → wrong → back → repeat forever.

## 🚀 What RakSound Does

RakSound lets you:

- 📂 Select one root folder containing all your sounds
- ⚡ Instantly scan thousands of audio files
- 🧠 Auto-infer smart categories from file names
- 🔎 Search across filename, folder, inferred tags, and path
- 🏷 Manually override categories (saved between sessions)
- 🌳 Browse a clean category tree with counts
- 🎧 Scrub and preview audio with a waveform
- ✂ Drag-select a portion of audio to export
- 💾 Quick-export clips with a single keypress
- 🔁 Never open a DAW just to trim a sound again

## 🖼 Waveform-Driven Editing

RakSound shows a full waveform for every sound.

You can:

- Click anywhere on the wave to start playback there
- Drag across the wave to select a region
- Play only that region
- Export only that region to a new WAV file

This is dramatically faster than opening audio editors.
