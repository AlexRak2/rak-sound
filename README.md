# rak-sound
RakSound turns massive, messy sound libraries into a searchable, taggable, waveform-driven workflow. Designed for developers and sound designers who download huge bundles like Sonniss/GDC packs and need a fast way to browse, preview, categorize, and export clips without loading them into a DAW.
